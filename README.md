Sample Game "Test"
===================

Welcome! Let start off by saying we created this not really as a _TEST_ but more of a way to see how you solve problems.
This was created fast, with assets from https://www.kenney.nl/.

## A Test?!
First off, let me just say, don't over think this.  Don't think of it as a test, think of it as a challenge!
This is mean to be EASY, but to show us how you would approach task, implement a solution and solve the problem.  There are always many ways to do the same thing!

## What to do?
So here are the tasks..

- First, implement movement inside the `CharacterMovement.cs` script.  We only need the cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  You don't need to implmenet any sort of animations, that should hopefully work already.

- Second, Implement the teleport.  You will see two teleport pads (that animate), there is a "skeleton" script that I would like you to implement the concept of teleporting from pad A to pad B.  You don't need to do any sort of animation/sounds (but can if you really want!)

- Lastly, implement a camera follow scruot.  There is no script currently, you will need to create one and implement the concept of the camera following the user as he moves back and forth.  We would prefer that you not use any plugins (as this can be achieved without), cinemachine is okay.  But using cinemaching in this context is a little bit of overkill.

## Now what?
If you have any questions you can ask myself (sheeoil) or James (birdbeak).

## When's this due?
Well, we think it shouldn't take very long.. but there is no time limit.  However, we would appreciate it if you complete it as soon as you can :)
